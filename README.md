# DukeStatSciBootcamp2018
This is the slide deck for the 2018 math bootcamp for the incoming Statistical Science Masters and PhD students at Duke University. 

The short bootcamp consists of 4 parts, aiming at refreshing students on pre-requisite knowledge for graduate-level Statistics courses:
1. Calculus 
2. Linear Algebra
3. Probability Theory
4. Statistical Inference

The slides for each are included in each folder. 

We prepared an assessment problem set to evaluate how the students grasped the bootcamp materials. Moreover, we put together a "challenge" problem set for 
students to have a bit more fun throughout the bootcamp.
